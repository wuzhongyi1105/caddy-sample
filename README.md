# Caddy

A [Docker](http://docker.com) image for [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com). This image includes the [git](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.git), [http.filter](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.filter) and [cloudflare](https://caddyserver.com/docs/tls.dns.cloudflare) plugins.  Plugins can also be configured via the `plugins` build arg.

### Credit

A big thank you to [abiosoft](https://github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker) whos this image is forked off.

### Telemetry
Telemetry has been enabled by default on this image! If you do not want this please use another docker image.

### Getting Started

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 2015:2015 adriel/caddy
```

Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015`.

ENV DOMAIN=your.domain

ENV PORT_80=80

ENV PORT_443=443

ENV EMAIL=you@your.addr

ENV USER=username

ENV PASSWORD=pass

ENV USE_SAMPLE=true

ENV USE_SIMPLE=false


EMAIL 
Your email for tls cert, Optional.


USER
Username for HTTPS proxy.


PASSWORD
Password for HTTPS proxy.


USE_SAMPLE
Generate a random website.


USE_SIMPLE
Enable proxy behind website.


> Be aware! If you don't bind mount the location certificates are saved to, you may hit Let's Encrypt rate [limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) rending further certificate generation or renewal disallowed (for a fixed period)! See "Saving Certificates" below!

### Saving Certificates

Save certificates on host machine to prevent regeneration every time container starts.
Let's Encrypt has [rate limit](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/rate-limits-for-lets-encrypt/6769).
```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -v $(pwd)/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile \
    -v $HOME/.caddy:/root/.caddy \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    adriel/caddy
```


Here, `/root/.caddy` is the location *inside* the container where Caddy will save certificates.

Additionally, you can use an *environment variable* to define the exact location Caddy should save generated certificates:

```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -e "CADDYPATH=/etc/caddycerts" \
    -v $HOME/.caddy:/etc/caddycerts \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    adriel/caddy
```

Above, we utilize the `CADDYPATH` environment variable to define a different location inside the container for
certificates to be stored. This is probably the safest option as it ensures any future docker image changes don't interfere with your ability to save certificates!

### PHP
`:[<version>-]php` variant of this image bundles PHP-FPM alongside essential php extensions and [composer](https://getcomposer.org). e.g. `:php`, `:0.10-php`
```sh
$ docker run -d -p 2015:2015 adriel/caddy:php
```
Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015` and you will see a php info page.

##### Local php source

Replace `/path/to/php/src` with your php sources directory.
```sh
$ docker run -d -v /path/to/php/src:/srv -p 2015:2015 adriel/caddy:php
```
Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015`.

##### Note
Your `Caddyfile` must include the line `on startup php-fpm7`. For Caddy to be PID 1 in the container, php-fpm7 could not be started.

### Using Cloudflare

Caddy can talk to Cloudflare via their API to automaticly confugure/update your Let's Encrypt certificates using the Cloudflare plugin (which has been included in this image).

Follow the [instrutions here](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#enabling-the-dns-challenge) to set it up.

### Using git sources

Caddy can serve sites from git repository using [git](https://caddyserver.com/docs/git) plugin.

##### Create Caddyfile

Replace `github.com/adriel/webtest` with your repository.

```sh
$ printf "0.0.0.0\nroot src\ngit github.com/adriel/webtest" > Caddyfile
```

##### Run the image

```sh
$ docker run -d -v $(pwd)/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile -p 2015:2015 abiosoft/caddy
```
Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015`.

## Usage

#### Default Caddyfile

The image contains a default Caddyfile.

```
0.0.0.0
browse
fastcgi / 127.0.0.1:9000 php # php variant only
startup php-fpm7 # php variant only
```
The last 2 lines are only present in the php variant.

#### Paths in container

Caddyfile: `/etc/Caddyfile`

Sites root: `/srv`

#### Using local Caddyfile and sites root

Replace `/path/to/Caddyfile` and `/path/to/sites/root` accordingly.

```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -v /path/to/sites/root:/srv \
    -v path/to/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile \
    -p 2015:2015 \
    abiosoft/caddy
```

### Let's Encrypt Auto SSL
**Note** that this does not work on local environments.

Use a valid domain and add email to your Caddyfile to avoid prompt at runtime.
Replace `mydomain.com` with your domain and `user@host.com` with your email.
```
mydomain.com
tls user@host.com
```

##### Run the image

You can change the the ports if ports 80 and 443 are not available on host. e.g. 81:80, 444:443

```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -v $(pwd)/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    abiosoft/caddy
```
